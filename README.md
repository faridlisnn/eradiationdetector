Electronic radiation detector repository contains my codes that were used in my thesis research. 
The title of the research is "X-rays Beam Quality Prediction in General Radiography using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Regression Technique". 
I extracted GLCM features and some other statistical features from medical images, and used it as input features to predict the Half Value Layer (HVL) of X-rays beam. 
The final model can be used to replace a radiation detector in measuring HVL, that is why the repository name is Electronic Radiation Detector.
